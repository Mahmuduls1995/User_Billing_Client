This project was React Node & MongoDB with [Live Link](https://billing-system-b6389.web.app/).

### How can you manage 10M+ users data in your DB? 
NoSQL databases such as MongoDB can support huge data sets (Big Data),MongoDB systems are distributed, non-relational databases that are designed for large-scale data storage and for parallel, high-performance data processing across a large number of servers. MongoDB databases are meant to scale horizontally, and are designed to scale to hundreds of millions and even billions of users doing updates and reads.

So, MongoDB gives every user a unique Id , I can easy get user data by search, and its modify as I want . And I can print data by document base.
